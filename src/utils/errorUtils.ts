/**
 * Error Handling Utilities
 *
 * This file contained utility functions for error handling that were not being used.
 * All unused exports have been removed to improve bundle size and maintainability.
 *
 * If you need error handling utilities in the future, consider implementing them
 * directly in the errorManager service or create specific utilities as needed.

// This file intentionally left minimal
// All previous exports were unused and have been removed
