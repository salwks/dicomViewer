# Cornerstone3D v3.32.5 Migration Critical Issues - PRD

## ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY: Breaking Changes Resolution

### Problem Statement
The upgrade from Cornerstone3D v1.77.9 to v3.32.5 has introduced critical breaking changes that are preventing core functionality from working properly. The application is currently in a non-functional state for key features.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Annotation Selection & Deletion System Failure
**Status**: CRITICAL - Core functionality broken
- Annotation selection not working with new v3 API structure
- Delete functionality fails due to changed annotation UID property names
- Users cannot delete selected annotations (major workflow blocker)

### 2. API Structure Changes
**Status**: HIGH - Multiple components affected
- `annotationUID` property may have changed to `uid`, `id`, or `annotationId`
- Selection API responses have different object structures
- Event handling may have changed

### 3. Tool System Compatibility
**Status**: MEDIUM - Some tools may not work correctly
- StackScrollMouseWheelTool deprecated (FIXED)
- Other tools may have API changes not yet discovered
- Tool activation/deactivation may have different behavior

### 4. Rendering Engine Integration
**Status**: MEDIUM - Performance and display issues
- Viewport rendering calls may have changed
- Memory management integration needs verification
- Performance optimization may be affected

## Requirements

### Must Have (P0 - Critical)
1. **Annotation Selection Must Work**
   - Users must be able to click on annotations to select them
   - Selected annotations must be visually highlighted (sky blue)
   - Selection state must be properly tracked

2. **Annotation Deletion Must Work**  
   - Delete/Backspace keys must remove only selected annotations
   - No accidental deletion of non-selected annotations
   - Proper cleanup and viewport re-rendering

3. **Core Tool Functionality**
   - All measurement tools (Length, Angle, Rectangle ROI, etc.) must create annotations
   - All navigation tools (Pan, Zoom, Window/Level) must work
   - Tool switching must work without errors

### Should Have (P1 - High)
1. **API Compatibility Layer**
   - Graceful handling of v1 vs v3 API differences
   - Fallback mechanisms for changed property names
   - Error handling for deprecated methods

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Memory management must work with v3
   - Rendering performance must be maintained
   - No memory leaks from API changes

### Could Have (P2 - Medium)
1. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Better error messages for API incompatibilities
   - Graceful degradation when features aren't available
   - Debug logging for troubleshooting

## Technical Specifications

### Annotation System Requirements
```typescript
// Must support both v1 and v3 annotation structures
interface AnnotationCompat {
  // v1 properties
  annotationUID?: string;
  
  // v3 possible properties
  uid?: string;
  id?: string;
  annotationId?: string;
  
  // Common properties
  metadata?: {
    toolName: string;
    viewPlaneNormal: number[];
    FrameOfReferenceUID: string;
  };
  
  data?: {
    handles: {
      points: number[][];
    };
  };
}
```

### Selection API Requirements
```typescript
// Must work with v3 selection API
annotation.selection.getAnnotationsSelected(): Annotation[]
annotation.selection.setAnnotationSelected(uid: string, selected: boolean, preserveSelected?: boolean): void
```

### Deletion API Requirements
```typescript
// Must work with v3 state API
annotation.state.removeAnnotation(uid: string): void
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Critical Success Metrics
1. **Annotation Workflow Complete**
   - âœ… Create annotation with any tool
   - âœ… Click annotation to select (sky blue highlight)
   - âœ… Press Delete/Backspace to remove selected annotation
   - âœ… Viewport updates properly after deletion

2. **Multi-annotation Management**
   - âœ… Multiple annotations can exist
   - âœ… Only selected annotation is deleted
   - âœ… Non-selected annotations remain untouched

3. **Cross-platform Compatibility**
   - âœ… Works on Mac (Backspace key)
   - âœ… Works on Windows (Delete key)
   - âœ… Works in all major browsers

### Quality Metrics
- Zero console errors during normal annotation workflow
- No memory leaks during annotation operations
- Response time < 100ms for selection/deletion operations

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: API Discovery & Compatibility (IMMEDIATE)
- Inspect actual v3 annotation object structures in runtime
- Create compatibility layer for property name differences
- Implement fallback mechanisms

### Phase 2: Core Functionality Restoration (URGENT)
- Fix annotation selection with correct v3 API calls
- Fix annotation deletion with correct UID handling
- Verify all tool operations work correctly

### Phase 3: Validation & Testing (HIGH)
- Test all annotation tools create proper v3 annotations
- Test selection/deletion workflow end-to-end
- Performance testing and optimization

### Phase 4: Error Handling & Polish (MEDIUM)
- Improve error messages and logging
- Add graceful degradation
- Code cleanup and documentation

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **API Breaking Changes**: Unknown additional breaking changes may exist
- **Data Structure Changes**: Annotation data format changes could cause data loss
- **Performance Impact**: V3 may have different performance characteristics

### Medium Risk
- **Browser Compatibility**: V3 may have different browser requirements
- **Memory Usage**: New version may have different memory patterns

### Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental testing after each fix
- Comprehensive logging to identify issues quickly
- Rollback plan to v1.77.9 if critical issues cannot be resolved quickly

## Success Definition
The migration is considered successful when:
1. All annotation tools create annotations that can be selected and deleted
2. Selection workflow works: click â†’ highlight â†’ delete key â†’ removed
3. No console errors during normal operations
4. Performance is equal to or better than v1.77.9 implementation
5. All existing features continue to work as expected
