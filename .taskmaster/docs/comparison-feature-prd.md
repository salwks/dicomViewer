# Cornerstone3D DICOM Viewer - Comparison Feature PRD

## Overview
Enhance the existing Cornerstone3D DICOM Viewer with comprehensive comparison capabilities, allowing healthcare professionals to compare multiple medical imaging studies side-by-side with advanced synchronization and analysis tools.

## Objectives
- Enable simultaneous viewing of multiple DICOM studies from same or different patients
- Provide intuitive viewport management for 1x2 and 2x2 comparison layouts
- Implement synchronization features for efficient comparative analysis
- Maintain seamless integration with existing single viewer functionality

## User Requirements

### 1. Study Selection and Loading
- **Multi-Study Selection UI**: Interface to select 2-4 studies for comparison
- **Patient Safety**: Clear visual indicators for different patient studies
- **Quick Load**: Ability to load studies via URL parameters or drag-and-drop
- **Study Metadata Display**: Show study date, modality, institution for each viewport

### 2. Viewport Layouts
- **1x2 Layout**: Side-by-side comparison of 2 studies
- **2x2 Layout**: Grid comparison of up to 4 studies
- **Flexible Assignment**: Drag studies to specific viewports
- **Dynamic Switching**: Toggle between single and comparison modes

### 3. Synchronization Features
- **Scroll Synchronization**: Synchronized scrolling through image stacks
- **Window/Level Sync**: Apply same brightness/contrast across viewports
- **Zoom/Pan Sync**: Synchronized zoom and pan operations
- **Cross-reference Lines**: Visual indicators showing corresponding anatomy
- **Selective Sync**: Enable/disable sync for specific operations

### 4. Annotation and Measurement
- **Independent Annotations**: Each viewport maintains own annotations
- **Copy Annotations**: Ability to copy measurements between viewports
- **Comparison Measurements**: Measure differences between studies
- **Annotation Visibility**: Toggle annotation display per viewport

### 5. User Interface
- **Mode Selector**: Clear UI to switch between single/comparison modes
- **Sync Controls Panel**: Centralized synchronization settings
- **Study Information Bar**: Display study details for each viewport
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Efficient navigation and control

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Architecture
- **Viewport Management Service**: Handle multiple viewport instances
- **Synchronization Engine**: Coordinate viewport states and events
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient handling of multiple loaded studies
- **State Persistence**: Save/restore comparison sessions

### 2. Performance
- **Load Time**: <5 seconds for 4-study comparison setup
- **Frame Rate**: Maintain 60fps during synchronized operations
- **Memory Usage**: <4GB for typical 4-study comparison
- **Cache Strategy**: Smart caching for frequently compared studies

### 3. Integration
- **URL Parameters**: Support comparison mode via URL
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API for comparison setup
- **Event System**: Emit events for external integrations
- **Export Capabilities**: Export comparison views

### 4. Browser Support
- **Chrome**: v90+
- **Firefox**: v88+
- **Safari**: v14+
- **Edge**: v90+

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Core Infrastructure)
- Viewport management system refactoring
- Multiple rendering engine support
- Basic 1x2 layout implementation
- Study selection interface

### Phase 2: Synchronization Engine
- Scroll synchronization implementation
- Window/level synchronization
- Zoom/pan synchronization
- Synchronization control panel

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- 2x2 layout support
- Cross-reference lines
- Annotation management
- Keyboard shortcuts

### Phase 4: Optimization and Polish
- Performance optimization
- Memory management improvements
- UI/UX refinements
- Documentation and testing

## Success Metrics
- **User Adoption**: 80% of radiologists use comparison mode weekly
- **Performance**: All operations complete within 100ms
- **Accuracy**: Zero synchronization drift over extended sessions
- **Satisfaction**: 4.5+ star rating from user feedback

## Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with existing single viewer mode
- Cannot exceed 4GB memory usage for typical workflows
- Must support all existing annotation tools
- Preserve HIPAA compliance and security standards

## Dependencies
- Cornerstone3D v3.x framework capabilities
- Browser WebGL support
- Adequate client hardware (8GB+ RAM recommended)

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Memory Pressure**: Implement aggressive garbage collection
- **Synchronization Lag**: Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth updates
- **Complex UI**: Provide progressive disclosure of features
- **Browser Limitations**: Implement graceful degradation

## Future Enhancements
- Support for more than 4 viewports
- AI-powered automatic alignment
- Temporal comparison for follow-up studies
- Cloud-based comparison sessions
