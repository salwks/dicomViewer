			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Structure and Environment Setup",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the environment setup into subtasks such as: (1) Define and create the folder structure, (2) Initialize npm and install dependencies, (3) Configure TypeScript, (4) Configure Webpack and dev server, (5) Create the base HTML template, (6) Implement the application entry point and verify initial build.",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational but follows standard patterns for modern TypeScript/JavaScript projects. Complexity arises from coordinating multiple configuration files and ensuring compatibility, but the steps are well-defined and not algorithmically complex."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Basic Viewport and Rendering Engine Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: (1) Implement viewport initialization, (2) Set up the rendering engine, (3) Configure DICOM image loader, (4) Implement image loading logic, (5) Create the basic viewer component, (6) Integrate all modules in an initialization script, (7) Validate with sample images and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating multiple libraries, handling asynchronous image loading, and ensuring the rendering pipeline works. It requires understanding of both the imaging domain and the rendering engine, increasing cognitive and cyclomatic complexity[1][2][4]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Volume Rendering Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Implement volume loader, (2) Register and configure volume loaders, (3) Implement 3D viewport creation, (4) Set up volume rendering options, (5) Implement MPR viewports, (6) Integrate MPR with volume data, (7) Create volume controller for property adjustments, (8) Test with multiple volume types and orientations.",
			"reasoning": "Volume rendering and MPR require advanced 3D graphics handling, multiple data formats, and complex UI interactions. The need for performance optimization and correct orientation handling further increases complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Measurement Tools Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Set up measurement tools infrastructure, (2) Implement length tool, (3) Implement angle tool, (4) Implement area tools (elliptical/rectangle), (5) Create measurement manager, (6) Integrate event handling for measurements, (7) Implement persistence and retrieval of measurements.",
			"reasoning": "Measurement tools require precise event handling, UI feedback, and data management. The need to support multiple measurement types and ensure accuracy across 2D/3D images adds to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Annotation System Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Implement annotation manager, (2) Implement text annotation tool, (3) Implement arrow annotation tool, (4) Add annotation event listeners, (5) Implement annotation styling module, (6) Integrate annotation persistence, (7) Test annotation interactions and rendering.",
			"reasoning": "Annotations require robust state management, event-driven updates, and flexible styling. Supporting both text and graphical annotations, along with persistence and UI integration, increases the task's complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Window/Level and Image Adjustment Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Implement window/level controller, (2) Define and manage presets, (3) Implement window/level tool integration, (4) Create UI panel for adjustments, (5) Integrate manual and preset controls, (6) Test adjustments on various image types.",
			"reasoning": "While the algorithms are not highly complex, integrating interactive controls, presets, and ensuring real-time feedback across different image types requires careful coordination and UI logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Zoom, Pan and Navigation Tools Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Implement zoom tool, (2) Implement pan tool, (3) Create zoom controls UI, (4) Add gesture handlers for touch, (5) Integrate mouse wheel and keyboard navigation, (6) Test navigation on multiple devices and viewport types.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple input modalities (mouse, touch, keyboard), real-time UI updates, and must be robust across devices. The logic is moderately complex due to event handling and synchronization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Image Rotation and Flip Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Implement rotation controller, (2) Implement flip controller, (3) Create orientation controls UI, (4) Integrate with viewport rendering, (5) Test orientation changes and reset functionality.",
			"reasoning": "The algorithms for rotation and flipping are straightforward, but integrating them with the UI and ensuring correct state management across different image types adds moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Multi-Viewport System Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Implement viewport manager, (2) Implement layout manager, (3) Create dynamic viewport creation/removal, (4) Implement synchronization manager, (5) Integrate pan/zoom/window-level sync, (6) Implement layout switching, (7) Handle viewport cleanup, (8) Test with various layouts and sync scenarios, (9) Document API for extensibility.",
			"reasoning": "Managing multiple viewports with dynamic layouts and synchronization is highly complex. It requires advanced state management, event propagation, and robust handling of edge cases, especially as the number of viewports and sync scenarios grows."
