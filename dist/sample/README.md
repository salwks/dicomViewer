# Sample DICOM Files

This directory contains sample DICOM files for testing the DICOM loader functionality.

## Adding Sample Files

To test the DICOM loading functionality, add a sample DICOM file named `sample.dcm` to this directory.

## Supported Formats

- Single DICOM files (.dcm, .dicom)
- DICOM image files with standard metadata
- Compressed and uncompressed DICOM formats

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Auto-load Sample**: When enabled in the DicomLoader component, it will automatically attempt to load `/sample/sample.dcm`
2. **Manual Upload**: Use the drag-and-drop or file picker functionality to load DICOM files
3. **DICOM Web**: Configure a DICOM Web server URL to load studies remotely

## Current Implementation Status

‚úÖ **Completed Features:**
- DICOM file loading service (RealDicomDataService)
- React hook for DICOM loading state management (useDicomLoader)
- Full-featured UI component with drag-and-drop support (DicomLoader)
- Integration with left side panel in tabbed interface
- Support for local files, sample files, and DICOM Web endpoints
- Annotation management integration with adapter pattern
- Progress tracking and error handling

üîÑ **Integration Status:**
- DICOM data loading ‚úÖ
- UI component integration ‚úÖ
- Side panel integration ‚úÖ
- Viewport rendering integration ‚è≥ (TODO: Connect to Cornerstone3D viewports)

## Next Steps

1. Add actual sample DICOM file (`sample.dcm`)
2. Test DICOM loading functionality
3. Integrate loaded DICOM data with Cornerstone3D viewport rendering
4. Connect series selection to viewport image display
