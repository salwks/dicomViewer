## 🛡️ Security Features

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: User preferences and sensitive settings are encrypted using AES-256
- **Secure Storage**: Local data is encrypted before storage in browser localStorage
- **Data Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- **DICOM Data Security**: Medical imaging data is handled with strict access controls

### Input Validation
- **Comprehensive Validation**: All DICOM parameters and user inputs are validated
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides compile-time type checking
- **Range Validation**: Numeric inputs are bounded to valid ranges
- **Format Validation**: DICOM tags and medical identifiers follow strict format rules

### Network Security
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Strict CSP headers prevent code injection
- **Security Headers**: HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options implemented
- **CORS Protection**: Cross-origin requests are properly controlled
- **Input Sanitization**: All external data is sanitized before processing

### Error Handling
- **Secure Error Messages**: Production errors don't expose sensitive information
- **Centralized Logging**: Secure logging system with environment-based controls
- **Error Boundaries**: React error boundaries prevent application crashes
- **Audit Trail**: Security events are logged for compliance

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Support for MFA through secure store
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with timeout controls
- **Role-Based Access**: Different access levels for different user roles
- **Password Security**: Secure password storage and validation

- **Secret Detection**: Automated scanning for hardcoded secrets

### Manual Testing
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused code review process
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Periodic third-party security audits

### Testing Schedule
- **Automated**: Every commit and pull request
- **Manual Code Review**: Every pull request
- **Dependency Audit**: Weekly automated scans via Dependabot
- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly assessments

## 🤖 Automated Security Management

### Dependabot Configuration
We use GitHub Dependabot for automated dependency vulnerability management:

- **Weekly Scanning**: Every Monday at 9 AM KST
- **Security Prioritization**: Critical security updates are automatically prioritized
- **Intelligent Grouping**: Related medical imaging dependencies (@cornerstonejs/*) are grouped
- **Production Focus**: Production dependencies receive priority for security updates
- **Review Process**: Security team automatically assigned to review security updates
- **Breaking Change Protection**: Major version updates require manual review

### Dependabot Process
1. **Automated Detection**: Dependabot scans for vulnerabilities weekly
2. **PR Creation**: Automatic pull requests created for security issues
3. **Team Notification**: Security team notified of all security-related PRs
4. **Review Required**: All security updates require review before merge
5. **Testing Integration**: Security tests run automatically on all Dependabot PRs
6. **Merge Timeline**: Security updates merged within 24 hours of review

## 🚀 Security Updates

### Update Process
1. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Evaluate impact and severity
2. **Fix Development**: Develop and test security patches
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing in staging environment
4. **Deployment**: Coordinated deployment to production
5. **Notification**: Notify users of security updates

### Emergency Patches
